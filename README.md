# EVM-Lite---V1
I built this because I wanted a simpler, better-looking version of VoiceMeeter or Sonar. It’s a floral-themed mixer that lets you grab your mic and any apps (Spotify, Discord, etc.) and pump them all into one virtual cable. Perfect for when you want your party to hear your music or soundboard. Designed by DocDotExe, using Gemini 3.
