# EVM - Lite 🌸

I made this app because I needed a cleaner way to handle audio routing without the bloat of bigger software. 

### How it works:
* **The Main Box:** This is your output (use your Virtual Cable here). It acts as the "microphone" for whatever app you're using (Discord, Zoom, etc.).
* **Add Sources:** You can add your actual mic, plus any other app like YouTube, Twitch, or a soundboard.
* **The Result:** It mixes everything together and sends it all through that one output so your friends/party can hear exactly what you want them to hear.

### Setup:
1. Grab the [VB-Audio Virtual Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) (Required).
2. Open **EVM_Lite_V1.exe**.
3. Route your apps and hit **Start Engine**.
